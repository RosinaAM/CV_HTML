        <!-- the "action" attribute indicates what should happen when the user clicks "submit". When filled with "index.html", it simply states to take the
        user back to the index.html page. Therefore, we change it to "mailto:myemail@gmail.com", so that the input is sent to my email address -->
        <!-- the "method="post"" attribute simply means that we transfer what the user has filled in the fields to user's email -->
        <!-- the "enctype" attribute on top of the page specifies that our website is encoded in UTF-8. Here, with "text/plain", we're saying that the data
        in our form are encoded in plain text. Then, when it launches the mail app, it won't have these funny programming signs such as "%", "+", numbers, etc.
        What will remain, though, is the name of the input element, i.e., "yourName =", "yourEmail =", "yourMessage =" -->
            <label>Your Name:</label>

            get to the JavaScript module, we're going to come back and revisit forms and we're going to unleash the full power of HTML forms.-->
